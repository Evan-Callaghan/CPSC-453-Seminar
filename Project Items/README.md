# Blockbuster Recommendation System Project

## Project Description:


## Algorithm Design:

```
Recommendations:
  
  FOR each item in blockbuster.csv
  
    IF the item is a movie
      THEN return the five-nearest neighbors as the recommendations from a movie data subset;
      
    ELSE (the item is a series)
      THEN return the five-nearest neighbors as the recommendations from a series data subset;
    
    ENDIF;
  
  ENDFOR;

END.
```
